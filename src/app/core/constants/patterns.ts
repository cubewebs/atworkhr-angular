// emailPattern is a regular expression pattern that matches a valid email address. It starts with ^ which indicates the start of the string, followed by a character class [a-z0-9._%+-] which matches any lowercase letter, digit, dot, underscore, percent sign, plus sign, or hyphen. Then it matches @, followed by another character class [a-z0-9.-] which matches any lowercase letter, digit, dot, or hyphen. Finally, it matches a dot \. followed by a character class [a-z]{2,4} which matches any lowercase letter repeated between 2 and 4 times. The pattern ends with $ which indicates the end of the string.
export const emailPattern: string = "^[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\\.[a-z]{2,4}$";

// passwordPattern is a regular expression pattern that matches a valid password. It starts with ^ which indicates the start of the string, followed by four positive lookaheads (?=.*[a-z]), (?=.*[A-Z]), (?=.*\d), and (?=.*[@$!%*?&]) which ensure that the password contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character from the set @$!%*?&. Then it matches a character class [A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&] which matches any uppercase or lowercase letter, digit, or special character from the set @$!%*?&. Finally, it matches {8,} which indicates that the password must be at least 8 characters long. The pattern ends with $ which indicates the end of the string.
export const passwordPattern: string = "^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?#|&])[A-Za-z\\d@$!%*?#|&]{8,}$"
